I am uisng Yii and want to use three or more models to share the same table in a mysql database. Here is the intended database structure:

Table User
id (int)
name (string)
role (string)
password_hash (string)


Model User
Model Admin (inherits User) (role = 'admin')
Model Teacher (inherits User) (role = 'teacher')
Model Student (inherits User) (role = 'student')
